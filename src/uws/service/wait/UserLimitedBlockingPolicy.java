/**
 * <p>This {@link BlockingPolicy} extends the {@link LimitedBlockingPolicy}. So, it proposes to limit the blocking duration
 * but it especially limits the number of blocked threads for a given job and user.</p>
 * 
 * <h3>Blocked by Job AND User</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 	As said, the limit on the number of threads is set ONLY for a given job AND a given user. Thus, an attempt to
 * 	access the same job with the blocking behavior is limited but even if the limit is reached the same user can
 * 	benefit from the blocking behavior with another job. Similarly a different user can access to the same job
 * 	even if the limit is reached for another user.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p><i>Note:
 * 	If no user is identified, the IP address will be used instead.
 * </i></p>
 * 
 * <h3>What happens when the limit is reached?</h3>
 * 
 * <p>In a such case, 2 strategies are proposed:</p>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>unblock the oldest blocked thread and accept the new blocking</li>
 * 	<li>do not block for the new asked blocking (then {@link #block(Thread, long, UWSJob, JobOwner, HttpServletRequest)} will return 0)</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 	The strategy to use MUST be specified at creation using {@link #UserLimitedBlockingPolicy(long, int, boolean)}
 * 	with a third parameter set to <code>true</code> to unblock the oldest thread if needed, or <code>false</code>
 * 	to prevent blocking if the limit is reached.
 * </p>
